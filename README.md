# katalog

This is a repository to commit the result of code katas and share implementation examples. You may find code in several programming languages used at L'Occitane (ex: javascript, java, kotlin, groovy, c#, python). 

# Goal 

Tech teams at L'Occitane can use this repository internally as a basis to learn & share what we consider to be the current coding sensible practices.

We plan to cover development fundamentals (ex: conditionals, loops, classes & functions, datastructures, exceptions), code quality concepts (ex: naming, complexity, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID) and core practices (tdd, unit testign techniques, refactoring)

It also seems necessary to cover basic tools (ide, git, build tools) at some point.

Further topics could include: advanced development (algorithmics, threading & concurrency, debugging), devops pipelines, specific development paradigms (api, frontend, cloud, mobile), advanced testing (integration, functional, property based unit tests, ...)
